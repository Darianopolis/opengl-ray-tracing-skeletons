# OpenGL Ray Tracing Skeletons

## Building

No build config is provided (for now)

You will need to compile and link the following along with a skeleton program:
- GLFW - Windowing
- Glad - OpenGL Loader
- glm - Maths library

## Skeletons

## Skeleton 01 - UV Test

Very basic skeleton program that just provides a texture, some utilities for drawing and resizing, and a basic blit to the framebuffer each frame.
