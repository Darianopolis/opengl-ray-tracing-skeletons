# OpenGL Ray Tracing Skeletons

Basic skeletons for ray tracing on the CPU in OpenGL

## Building

No build config is provided (for now)

You will need to compile and link the following along with a skeleton program:
- GLFW - Windowing
- Glad - OpenGL Loader
- glm - Maths
- ImGui - GUI (not required for skeleton 01)

## Skeletons

## Skeleton 01 - UV Test

Very basic skeleton program that just provides a texture, some utilities for drawing and resizing, and a basic blit to the framebuffer each frame.

## Skeleton 02 - ImGui

\+ ImGui support\
\+ Adjustable UV pattern parameters\
\+ Scalable Texture size\
\+ Weighted + Jittered samples
